#  NLP Project using TF-IDF (Python)

#  Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques in Python, with a focus on **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)** for text representation.  
It is designed to preprocess textual data, extract meaningful features, and enable tasks such as text similarity, classification, or recommendation.
